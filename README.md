### Hi, I'm Alex 🏴󠁵󠁳󠁣󠁯󠁿🏔️

I'm a software engineer living near Denver, Colorado, USA.

I love open source software, learning new concepts, building neat projects, and climbing steep trails. I keep most of the code I share on
[a GitLab group](https://gitlab.com/alexlab-cloud) where I can organize things with a bit more control.
