## Hi, I'm Alex üèîÔ∏è

I'm a software engineer living near Denver, Colorado, USA.

I love open source software, learning new concepts, building neat projects, and climbing steep trails. I've worked on
projects ranging from preclinical MRI data analysis for novel studies to web apps that have delivered solutions to
enterprise-level customers.

I keep most of the code I share on [a GitLab group](https://gitlab.com/alexlab-cloud) where I can organize things with
a bit more control.
